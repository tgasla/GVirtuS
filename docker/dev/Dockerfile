## This Dockerfile is for building a GVirtuS image with CUDA support.
## It does not include the Gvirtus source code, as it is expected to be mounted at runtime (useful for development).
## The image will be pushed at taslanidis/gvirtus-dependencies:cuda12.6.3-cudnn-ubuntu22.04 using the `make docker-build-push-dev` command.
